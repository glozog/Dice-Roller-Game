# Dice Roller Game
A simple Dice Roller game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Roll the dice and test your luck! This game simulates a traditional six-sided die, displaying a random result with each roll. It's designed with a minimalistic interface that allows users to roll the dice with a single click.

# Features
* Random Dice Rolls: Each time you click the roll button, a random number between 1 and 6 is generated.
* Dice Animation: A rolling animation gives a more realistic dice-rolling experience.
* Clean and Simple UI: The interface is easy to use with a large dice graphic and a single roll button.
* Responsive Design: Play the game on any device — whether on desktop, tablet, or mobile, the layout adapts accordingly.

# Demo

# Technologies Used
* HTML: Structures the game layout, including the dice and the button.
* CSS: Styles the page and adds a dice-rolling animation for a more engaging experience.
* JavaScript: Generates a random number and updates the die's face accordingly.

# Game Logic Breakdown
* Random Number Generation: Each time you click the roll button, JavaScript generates a random number between 1 and 6.
* Updating the Dice Face: The generated number is then used to display the corresponding face of the dice.
* Animation: The dice "rolling" animation adds a delay before showing the final result, enhancing the user experience.
